## 📌 Features

- 🧱 Microservices Architecture (4 independent APIs)
- 🧅 Onion Architecture in each service
- 💾 SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
- 🔐 JWT Authentication + Role Management
- 🔁 Resilient communication using **Polly**
- 📊 Centralized logging with **Serilog**
- 🚪 API Gateway using **Ocelot**
- 🧰 Manual Mapping for performance and flexibility
- 🧹 Global Exception Middleware + Request Routing Middleware
